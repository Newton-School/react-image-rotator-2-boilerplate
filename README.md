# React image rotator one

We have an image of star, what we need to implement is 
on each click on star, the image rotates by a certain number of degrees, 
by default <em>5deg</em>.

The <code>input#rotateby-input</code> dictates by how much the star will rotate on each click.
Example:-
So initally for default value of 5.
Image has transform:rotate(0deg)
After first click
Image has transform:rotate(5deg)
After second click
Image has transform:rotate(10deg)

and so on like that

Ex:- Upon changing to <code>input#rotateby-input</code> 1

Image has transform:rotate(0deg)
After first click
Image has transform:rotate(1deg)
After second click
Image has transform:rotate(2deg)
and so on
